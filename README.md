# IBM Data Science Capstone Project - SpaceX

## Introduction

In this capstone, we applied data science methodologies to predict the successful landing of the Falcon 9 first stage. Additionally, we summarized the results for business stakeholders. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website at a cost of $62 million, significantly lower than the $165 million charged by other providers. This cost reduction is largely due to SpaceX's ability to reuse the first stage of the rocket. By predicting the likelihood of the first stage landing successfully, we can better estimate the cost of a launch. This information is valuable for alternate companies looking to compete with SpaceX in the rocket launch market. 

This capstone project course offers a hands-on experience of the challenges data scientists face when working with real-world datasets. You will step into the role of a Data Scientist at a startup aiming to compete with SpaceX, applying the data science methodology throughout the process [data collection](https://github.com/marchesiello/IBM-Data-Science-Capstone-SpaceX/blob/main/Data%20Collection%20API.ipynb), [data wrangling](https://github.com/marchesiello/IBM-Data-Science-Capstone-SpaceX/blob/main/Data%20Wrangling.ipynb), [exploratory data analysis](https://github.com/marchesiello/IBM-Data-Science-Capstone-SpaceX/blob/main/EDA%20with%20SQL.ipynb), [data visualization](https://github.com/marchesiello/IBM-Data-Science-Capstone-SpaceX/blob/main/EDA%20with%20Data%20Visualization.ipynb), [model development](https://github.com/marchesiello/IBM-Data-Science-Capstone-SpaceX/blob/main/Machine%20Learning%20Prediction.ipynb), [model evaluation](https://github.com/marchesiello/IBM-Data-Science-Capstone-SpaceX/blob/main/Machine%20Learning%20Prediction.ipynb), and [reporting](https://github.com/marchesiello/IBM-Data-Science-Capstone-SpaceX/blob/main/Winning%20Space%20Race%20with%20Data%20Science.pdf) your results to stakeholders. You are tasked with predicting if the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully. 

## Business Problem
SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches at $62 million, significantly less than the $165 million charged by other providers. This cost efficiency is primarily due to SpaceX's ability to reuse the first stage of the rocket. By accurately predicting the likelihood of a successful first stage landing, you can better estimate the overall launch cost. Your data science insights and models will enable the startup you work for to make more competitive bids against SpaceX for rocket launches. 

## Objective
- Utilize data science tools and machine learning techniques to accurately predict the likelihood of the first stage rocket landing successfully, thereby estimating the launch cost.
- Analyze and explore the data to gain deeper insights and uncover valuable information.

## Business metric
Classification accuracy is defined as the number of correct predictions divided by the total number of predictions. It is calculated using the formula:
$$Accuracy = \frac{TP+TN}{TP+FP+TN+FN}$$
where TP is the number of true positives, TN is the number of true negatives, FP is the number of false positives, and FN is the number of false negatives.
